        <h1>"The Second Option"</h1>
        <p>Smack in the middle of the East and West side of Harlem there sits an old park named after a legend. Jackie Robinson Park is home to three important things; It holds a playground where the youth of Harlem build the very early memories of their childhoods, and acts as building stones for the rest of life to come. Jack Robinson Park is home to a small Basketball court that never had nets, but doesn't seem to need any. People of all ages and looks are found on this court, socializing, and forming connection through the game of Basketball that has been passed through generations. It definitely wouldn't be Jackie Robinson Park without the 2 signature baseball fields. These fields are home to all sorts of things. From the little league games with impatient 8 year olds sweating profusely, to late night talks when the sun starts setting; this baseball field is home to much more than just baseball.</p>
        <p>Many people wonder why Jackie Robinson Park even exists, much less why people evengo there. The legendary Rucker Park is located only five blocks away and that park is way more legendary, I mean Kobe Bryant himself played on that court along with many other of the greats. Their Baseball Field has greener grass, the hoops have nice nets, and the playgrounds are cleaner. However, for some odd reason I’ve never preferred Rucker. Sure Rucker has more history than Jackie Robnson and a lot of “better” things but it still doesn't have the most important part: Connection. I’ve seen every corner of JRP (Jackie Robinson Park), and from being a little kid, sliding down the slide in the playground, to making my way to the baseball fields on my first little league game day, to becoming one of those teenagers that I used to watch playing Basketball. With all that being said it is true that JRP knows more of me than I do of it. That can be said for all of us that have experienced it in the way that I have. JRP will accept anyone as long as you abide by its strict rules. Be respectful. Watch Yourself. Don’t Do Anything Stupid. After following these rules is when JRP becomes fun. You notice all the different walks of life that cross through its path. You learn where to go and where not to go.</p>
        <p>After going there all my life, I see the sense of community that JRP has to offer. Somewhere like Rucker has different people coming through day in and day out. Tourists. JRP holds a real community. It's almost like a routine schedule. You go to a place at a certain time and it's almost a guarantee a certain person or group will be there, and will welcome you. The most important thing about the JRP community is that it doesn't reject. You can see from the kids, to the teenagers, to the nervous adults watching their kids take on baseball for the first time, nobody looks for problems and everyone embraces each other. That cannot be said for everywhere. In the big city of New York things section off quite easily. Whether you want to see it or not, the theory of “a mixing pot of connection” isn't as true as it seems. On the other hand, Harlem, I can see is an area with vast change. A strong community is fighting gentrification and the system is fighting back. I hear my parents talking about how surrounding rent is going up, I see new restaurants open, old ones close. I see homeless people flock out of the subway station in groups because a sudden renovation is taking place. I see a constant in all of this. I walk down to JRP where all is moving harmoniously. The new residents are playing basketball with the old ones. I see new families at the playground, and their kids get along perfectly with each other. As I walk past the baseball fields there's a variety of kids sitting on the bench eating peanuts. It gives me hope. Our society pushes division on communities. Our society is plagued by people telling us who hates who and who should be separate, it's a constant battle. The community of Harlem as a whole fights against this by the display of its connection and through teaching us to come together, and connect with each other, even through the constant turmoil in the outside world.</p>
